Calculus is useful for modeling and understanding dynamics that evolve over time. The two main concepts calculus gives us are derivitaives and integrals.

## Differential Calculus

Differential Calculus: This is about derivatives, which tell you how fast things are changing at any point. 
If you're monitoring a system and see a sudden spike in traffic, differential calculus can help you understand the rate of change and potentially identify malicious processes.

## Integral Calculus

Integral Calculus: Integrals are, in a way, the opposite of derivatives. They accumulate quantities over time.
If you're tracking data transfer over a network, integrals can give you the total amount of data moved over a period, which is handy for detecting data exfiltration.


## Illustration

Red line (Rate of Change of Traffic Volume Over Time) is the derivative of the traffic volume. It shows the speed of change in the traffic volume at each point in time. Sharp increases (spikes) can indicate a sudden surge in traffic, while sharp decreases (dips) can suggest a sudden drop.
In cybersecurity, this could indicate potential anomalies like DDoS attacks, breaches, or network interruptions that may warrant further investigation.

Green line (Cumulative Traffic Volume Over Time) is the practical application of integration to your dataset.
It's an integral because it represents the sum (integral) of the traffic volume data points over the time period observed.

Together, these plots give a comprehensive picture of network activity, with the ability to identify when high volumes of data are being transferred,
when significant fluctuations occur, and how much data has been transferred in total over time.
Understanding these patterns is key in detecting and investigating potential security incidents in a network.
