# Graph Theory

Graph can be used for a couple different things. like path traversal and grouping. One of the highlights of graph it is the most visual. For some analyses you need to create a chart to demonstrate the immportant
takeaways, in 

Path traversal, moving in physical space to find the shortest path from point A to B.

Example of Path Traversal in HTB CTF- `https://github.com/dbissell6/DFIR/blob/main/WalkThroughs/Cyber_Apocalypse_2024.md#path-of-survival---hard`

Groups - graph built on linear algebra concepts allows us to look at relationships of high dimesnioanl objects. How 'far' these objects are away from eachother can help us to identify groups and patterns.

Networking. Looking at something like how resilient a network is can be done by graph. 

2 kinds of objects, nodes (The objects) and edge(the relationships to of one node to another).

## Nodes

### Attributes

## Edges

### Directional - Bidirectional
