# Math4Cyber

Welcome to Math4Cyber — This repository is designed to bridge the gap between theoretical math and practical cyber applications. A guided journey through the realms of calculus, algebra, graph theory, culminating in machine learning.
It's perfect for new cyber security enthusiasts who want to understand not just the "how" but also the "why" behind the math that powers the domain of cybersecurity. 

## Structure

The first 6 lessons align with MITs Math bootcamp for engineering. It just felt that graph and machine learning were the natural next steps so i kept it moving.

## Cyber Examples with Python

Each section comes alive with Python examples, providing hands-on experience to see the math in action. We'll work through simulations and analyses that reflect actual cyber security challenges—because the best way to learn math is by applying it to problems you're passionate about solving.
