# Machine Learning

It really doesnt need an intro, you have heard about it everyday. AI is here to replace you. But how exactly does it do it?

## Types of machine learning

When we teach a machine we typically do so in 3 ways. 

1) Supervised Learning

2) Unsupervised Learning

3) Reinforcement Learning


## The flow

Machine learnings first couple steps are the same as using most functions. There is an input, the function functions, there is an output. In machine leanring, during the training phase, the machine output
is compared to the correct answer(For instance, if the machine was being trained to guess a picture of a cat or dog, after it said cat, it would be compared to the answer for the photo. This is a problem with kind of learning,
training takes many examples and each examples answer has to be labled by a person.

Inputs Weights -> Summation Activation -> Propagation -> Output -> Back Propogation and Weight Adjustment

## Propagation

## Output

The output can be thought of as the algorithms answer, or response. 

## Back Propogation and Weight Adjustment
